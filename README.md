Read me:
1. The ruby word count is used to obtain the histogram to obtain the cipher key
2. The generate_decrypted_file.rb generates the decrypted file_paths

Note: Ruby 2.4.0 was used to run the following code, but most versions of ruby should support the code.
Usage:
1. ruby ruby ruby_word_count.rb
2. ruby generate_decrypted_file.rb
